The “Litmus Test”
Ask yourself these 3 questions about a specific piece of data (e.g., a list of products, a user profile, a blog post):

Does this data change while the user is looking at it? (e.g., live stock prices, chat messages, notification counts)
Does the user interact with this data to change it? (e.g., “Like” button, “Edit” form, “Delete” item)
Is this data used in multiple, disconnected places simultaneously? (e.g., User Avatar in Header AND User Email in Settings form)
If you answered “YES” to ANY of these:

🚀 Use React Query (Hydration Pattern).

If you answered “NO” to ALL of these:

🛑 Use Standard Server Components (Direct Fetch).
